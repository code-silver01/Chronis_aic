Generated: {today}
Test suite status: **{status}**

## 1. Encryption Daemon (Day 1)
Full key hierarchy implemented: DIK (generated once, never leaves secure
storage), DSK (derived daily from DIK + date, never persisted), UPK
(wraps outer encryption layer), Server Transport Key (fresh per upload
session). `write_to_storage()` structurally rejects anything that isn't
an `EncryptedRecord` — Rule 1 is enforced at the type level, not by
convention.

## 2. Boot Sequence + Failure Handling (Day 2)
Boot order implemented exactly as specified. One automated test per
failure mode in the spec table, all passing against the mock HAL.
**Open gap:** `power_rails` and `clock_sync` have no explicit row in the
spec's failure table — currently defaulted to HALT-on-failure as a
conservative choice. Confirm this is the intended behavior with the team.

## 3. Watchdog (Day 3)
Confirmed: encryption daemon failure -> full system HALT (not a restart).
All other daemon failures -> restart of just that daemon.

## 4. Power Management Daemon (Day 3)
All four power states (Full Active, Conservation, Critical, Emergency)
implemented and tested against mock battery voltage readings, including
the notify-once-on-entry behavior for Conservation and the
ceiling-conflict rule (lower of state-machine level vs. power-state
ceiling always wins — this is a preview of the Day 5 cross-track test).
Charge-cycle counting flags "replacement may be needed soon" at 500
cycles. Daily power report structure implemented.

## 5. Power & Thermal Projection (Day 3) — PLANNING ESTIMATE ONLY
**Not measured, not verified.** Pulled from public datasheets and
estimated duty cycles per capture-intensity level. Battery capacity
placeholder: {BATTERY_CAPACITY_MAH}mAh — update once a real cell is chosen.

| Level | Estimated draw | Estimated runtime |
|---|---|---|
{build_power_table()}

Thermal ceiling: not modeled — needs a real thermal simulation or
datasheet junction-temperature figures once components are locked.

## 6. Enclosure (Day 3)
First-pass CAD skeleton and dimension-input checklist in
`enclosure/enclosure_notes.md`. Datasheet-dimensions-only — see the
explicit gap list below.

## 7. Full Test Suite Output
```
{test_output}
```

## 8. Explicit List of What Needs Real-Hardware Confirmation
- Actual I2C/communication-bus address conflicts between motion sensor,
  heart-rate sensor, and any other bus-sharing components — cannot be
  caught in simulation.
- Real thermal behavior under sustained L4/L5 load.
- Real physical fit and manufacturing tolerances for the enclosure —
  current CAD model checks bounding boxes only.
- Real battery discharge curve — current model uses a generic lithium
  curve as a stand-in.
- `power_rails` / `clock_sync` failure behavior — currently a conservative
  default (HALT), not an explicit spec decision. Confirm with the team.
- Real component current draw at each capture-intensity level — current
  numbers are datasheet typical-case figures, not measured under this
  specific firmware's actual duty cycle.
