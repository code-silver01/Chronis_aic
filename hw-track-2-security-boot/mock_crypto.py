"""
Mock Crypto Interface — Track HW-2, Day 1
TEMPORARY STAND-IN for the real ATECC608B security chip API surface.
Matches the function shape the real chip driver will eventually expose:
generate_keypair(), sign(), verify(). Uses real software crypto
(the `cryptography` library) underneath, so behavior is cryptographically
correct — only the "chip" part is fake. Delete this file and swap in the
real chip driver once hardware arrives; nothing above this layer changes.

CURVE CHOICE: NIST P-256 (secp256r1) with ECDSA — this is deliberate, not
arbitrary. The ATECC608B only supports P-256 for ECDSA sign/verify, not
Ed25519. If this mock used Ed25519 instead, "swap the mock for the real
chip" would actually mean "rewrite the signing logic," which defeats the
entire point of building against a mock today. Matching the real chip's
actual algorithm now is what makes the later swap a one-line change.
